			<p>The accessibility of a publication is useful to know regardless of a person's abilities, as features such as the ability to make visual adjustments make for a better reading experience for everybody. This document proposes a shared framework for presenting publication accessibility metadata declarations in a user-friendly manner — to offer the information to end users in a way that is easy to understand regardless of their technical knowledge and is consistent across different publications and different digital catalogs. </p>
		</section>

<section id="intro">
   <h2>Introduction</h2>
 
	     			<p>Reading a publication is a very personal experience. For most   people this is routine, and   little
				consideration is given to how   the title was obtained before it is read. Users may go to a bookstore, search for the
				title to purchase online, or have the title selected for them by an instructor for a class.</p>

			<p>Now consider that the person is blind and relies on assistive technology. The user  needs that technology to assist them in
				the purchase process as well as to read the publication. The person  may wonder: will the screen reader work with
				this title; are there image descriptions that will be spoken to describe these images; are there page
				numbers which are accessible; is the reading order correct so a caution after reading a
				paragraph which could be dangerous will be announced? All of these, and more accessibility concerns are potential issues
				consumers have when trying to purchase and ultimately read a digital publication.</p>

			<p>The good news is more and more publishers are creating publications that are Born Accessible (i.e.,
				accessible from the outset, not fixed later) and getting the accessibility validation or audit done by
				independent organizations.</p>

   
</section>
		<section id="general-overview">
			<h2>General overview</h2>

			<p>This document helps those who wish to render accessibility metadata directly to users understand how to
				represent the accessibility claims inherent in machine-readable accessibility metadata in a user-friendly User Interface / User Experience
				(UI/UX). This document   targets implementers such as  bookstores, retailers, distributors etc. Content creators will benefit from reading these Principles and are encouraged to follow <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub-a11y-11/">EPUB Accessibility 1.1 Conformance and Discoverability Requirements section and its techniques.</a></p>

			<div class="note">
				<p>This document presents high-level principles without going into technical issues related to the
					different metadata standards in the publishing industry. </p>
				<p>Therefore, <a href="#techniques">techniques are available</a> that illustrate to developers how to
					retrieve data to show the information outlined in this document.</p>
			</div>

			<p>Metadata found either inside a digital publication or in a corresponding external record may have
				important accessibility claims  that helps end users find and determine if the publication can meet
				their specific accessibility needs.</p>

			<p>All accessibility metadata is meant to be machine-readable – apart from the accessibility summary - in
				this way accessibility metadata can be extracted and displayed uniformly across different publications
				and localized to different user interface languages.</p>

			<p>One important aspect is that the role of the Accessibility Summary metadata has changed in the latest
				version of the EPUB Accessibility specification, so a more in-depth analysis in the <a
					href="#accessibility-summary">Accessibility summary</a> section is recommended.</p>

			<p>This document offers guidance on how to aggregate and display claims inherent  in metadata to end users; these are not strict
				guidelines, but suggestions for providing a consistent experience for users through different portals.
				Different implementers may choose to implement these guidelines in a slightly different way, some examples
				can be seen in the <a href="#implementations">Implementations</a> section of the document.</p>
<section id="accessibility-claims">
<h2>Accessibility claims and declarations</h2>

<p>When  presenting  accessibility metadata provided by the publisher, it is suggested that the section is introduced using  terms  such as "claims" or "declarations." This heading should clearly convey  to the end user that the information comes directly from the publisher and represents the accessibility information that the publisher intends to communicate.
</p>
</section>

            <section id="metadata-ecosystem">
                <h2>Publisher metadata ecosystem</h2>
<p>It is helpful to visualize the metadata workflow. The image below shows the path publisher's metadata takes to get to the end user through a distributor or library.  The two paths visualized for EPUB accessibility metadata and ONIX correspond to the techniques referenced in the linked techniques documents.</p>
                    <figure>
                        <figcaption>Flowchart: Metadata Ecosystem</figcaption>
                        <img class="responsive" src="media/MetadataEcosystem.jpg" aria-details="ecosystem" alt="Digital Publication Ecosystem flows into four areas: Metadata Delivery, Accessibility Metadata spec, Metadata Processing, and Resulting Statements" />
                    </figure>
                    <details id="ecosystem">
                        <summary>Flowchart's Detailed Description</summary>
                        <p>
                            The digital publication ecosystem has two main channels of "Metadata Delivery": "Embedded inside the EPUB", and "Thru the supply chain."</p>
                        <p>
                            From the "Metadata Delivery" this flows into the "Accessibility Metadata spec" where from "Embedded inside the EPUB" flows into the "EPUB Accessibility Metadata 1.1 specification", and from "the supply chain" flows into the "ONIX Accessibility metadata." At this same level the "Crosswalk" links between the EPUB and ONIX metadata. </p>
                        <p>
                            From here both flow down into the "Metadata Processing" layer where the EPUB metadata gets processed through the "Display Techniques for EPUB Accessibility Metadata", and the "ONIX accessibility metadata" is processed through the "Display Techniques for ONIX Accessibility Metadata."</p>
                        <p>
                            Finally from the "Metadata Processing" layer both the Display Techniques for EPUB and ONIX flow into the "Resulting Statements" layer "Accessibility Metadata Display Guide for Digital Publications"</p>

				<h3>Metadata techniques</h3>

				<p>To assist developers in implementing these guidelines, in-depth notes are available to explain how to
					extract information from publishing industry metadata standards.</p>

				<p>At the time of publishing this document the available techniques for metadata standards are:</p>

				<ul>
					<li>
						<p><a href="../techniques/epub-metadata/index.html">EPUB Accessibility Metadata</a></p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p><a href="../techniques/onix-metadata/index.html">ONIX Accessibility Metadata</a></p>
					</li>
				</ul>
<div class="note">
<p>Publishers update their ONIX records as needed. We expect "unknown" accessibility metadata may be initially provided but may change as more information becomes available. For this reason, implementors should be prepared to update the accessibility metadata as new ONIX feeds are made available.</p>
</div>
			</section>

		</section>
		<section id="general-info">
			<h2>General information</h2>
			<p>To solve the problem of displaying the accessibility metadata in a human readable form, vendors will determine their correct statement to display (from the Accessibility Metadata Display Guide for Digital Publications) by parsing the metadata and using the appropriate Display Techniques document. </p>

			<p>The product details provide precious information about the usability of the book in relation to specific user needs. The following information should always be displayed:</p>

			<ul>
				<li> File format (EPUB 2 or 3, PDF, MP3, Audiobook, etc.) </li>
				<li> Protection measure or lack thereof </li>
				
				<li> Name of the publishing house </li>
				<li> Main language of the content </li>
			</ul>

			<h3>Why this information is important for accessibility</h3>
			
			<ul>
				<li> The file format gives a strong indication of accessibility: an MP3 format audiobook will be less
					structured than an Audiobook; a PDF does not allow for typography modification, EPUB 2 is deprecated, an EPUB 3 supports page navigation and better structural semantics, etc. </li>
				<li> The protection measure may block assistive technologies such as screen readers. In addition, many
					specific reading devices such as DAISY readers or Braille notepads are not equipped to read
					encrypted files. </li>
				
				<li> The name of the publishing house can highlight the efforts it has made in terms of accessibility. </li>
				<li> The main language of the content enables readers to be confident that they will be able to read
					with their Assistive Technology that uses synthesized voice or the corresponding Braille table for
					the language. </li>
			</ul>

  
		</section>
		<section id="order-of-key-information">
			<h2>Key accessibility information</h2>

			<div class="note">
				<p>When the content creator does not provide any accessibility metadata for a publication, the three
					pieces of key information that should always be present can still be shown (with an indication that
					the information is missing): <a href="#visual-adjustments">Visual adjustments</a>, <a href="#supports-nonvisual-reading">Supports nonvisual reading</a>,
						and <a href="#conformance-group"
						>Conformance</a>.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="note">
				<p>This document does not define the order in which to show the key accessibility information; each
					implementer can decide the preferred order for showing the accessibility information that
					follows.</p>
<p>In this document  are   examples of       important metadata  that is expected  to be in a wide range of publications. However, we do not have examples of all possible features that the metadata can express. The techniques have more values than are shown in the examples.
</p>

							the metadata is not known). </p>
				</div>

				<p>Indicates if users can modify the appearance of the text and the page layout according to the
					possibilities offered by the reading system.</p>

				<p>This field answers whether visual adjustments are possible, not possible, or unknown.</p>

				<p>Readers with visual impairments or cognitive disabilities need the ability to change the color of
					text and its background (contrast), the font family and font size used, as well as spacing between
					letters, words, sentences, or paragraphs.</p>

				<p><!--this one might be moved to the techniques-->Knowing that a publication can reflow to fit the
					reading system's display area is not sufficient to know that modifications to the font, spacing, and
					colors are possible or that the changes will not cause other readability issues (e.g., text being
					clipped by its container).</p>

				<p>This field answers whether nonvisual reading is possible, not possible, or unknown.</p>

				<p>Digital publications with essential content included in non-textual form (such as graphs, tables or
					equations presented as images, videos, etc.) must include textual alternatives to ensure that users
					reading with other senses than sight (mainly auditory and tactile) have access to the same

Always get legal advice from in-house or your retained counsel to assess legal compliance and risk.</div>

<p>In some jurisdictions publishers may be able to claim an exemption from the provision of accessible publications, including the provision of accessibility metadata. This should always be subject to clarification by legal counsel for each jurisdiction.
	One example of this, at time of writing, is from the European Accessibility Act (EAA) when the publisher is a micro-enterprise (i.e., enterprises employing fewer than 10 people and with annual turnover or balance sheet total not exceeding 2 million euro).</p>
<p>Other legal considerations currently included in the EAA may include exceptions on individual versions of a title, where jurisdiction will not require the title to be accessible if it involves a fundamental alteration of the content, or if making it accessible would place a disproportionate burden on the publisher. (This may vary in other jurisdictions).</p>

<p>Publishers may need to include information about an exemption or exception in metadata for legal or clarity reasons, either to bodies that enforce legislation or for other business to business communication. However this is not information that needs to be displayed on public sites as it does not mean anything to most consumers and could lead to misunderstandings. Nevertheless, the objective is to provide as much accessibility information as is possible.</p>

			<h2>Discovering accessible content</h2>

			<p>The guidelines for presenting accessibility metadata detailed in this document are intended to improve
				the user experience when readers browse the catalogue entry for a publication. However, accessibility
				metadata also has a vital role to play in helping readers discover publications that are accessible to
				them.</p>
			<p>Publication providers, such as vendors and libraries create searching and filtering tools that interpret
				accessibility metadata to aid in discovery. The set and variety of filters depend on the public they
				address and the type of book they propose. </p>
			<p> User feedback indicates that in the absence of specific accessibility filters, they find product details like file
				format and protection measures (e.g., digital rights management) crucial information in determining usability.</p>
			<p>Taking into consideration those realities, the following sections  propose a minimum and an
				extension set for filtering options. Mostly any specific information could be added if considered of use
				for the public of the platform.</p>


			<section id="minimum-filtering-set">
				<h3>Minimum filtering set</h3>
				<p> Reading systems, commerce, and distribution platforms will typically have specific filtering
					options; having uniformity for key aspects and providing guidance for a standardized approach can
					help the discovery process for users searching for relevant titles. Accomplishing this, however, should
					not prevent users with specific reading needs from finding books they are looking for. To achieve
					this goal, it is recommended that all platforms present two minimum capabilities, centered around the
					ways of consuming the content. These are:</p>
				<ol>
					<li>Titles that support nonvisual reading</li>
					<li>Titles that support visual adjustments</li>
				</ol>
				<p>Of note, only the positive values should be used.</p>
				<aside class="example" title="Minimum filtering options">
					<ul>
						<li>Supports Nonvisual Reading</li>
						<li>Supports Visual Adjustments</li>
					</ul>
				</aside>
			</section>
			<section id="extended-filtering-set">
				<h3>Extended filtering set</h3>
				<p> In specific domains, the addition of other options will become important to help users find content
					that responds to a particular need or scenarios. Each domain case would uniquely drive the selection
					of appropriate items. Some examples of these domains (not exclusive) are:</p>
				<ul>
					<li> In an academic context, the presence of printed page numbers may be crucial to make sure the
						reader will be able to find or make a reference. </li>
					<li> In a technical or scientific context, the information about ways provided to access complex
						contents like Charts, Diagrams, and Formulas would have a strong importance to know if
						accessibility markup were present.</li>
					<li> In markets where compliance to legislation is required, understanding conformity information
						becomes mandatory. </li>
					<li> Platforms dedicated to selling children's books and interactive content may want to allow users
						to select books with no hazards or inform them about the presence of pre-recorded audio. </li>
				</ul>
				<aside class="example" title="Extended filtering options">
					<ul>
						<li>Page list</li>
						<li>Charts, Diagrams, and Formulas</li>
						<li>Minimum accessibility standards (A)</li>
						<li>Accepted accessibility standards (AA)</li>
						<li>No hazards</li>
						<li>Pre-recorded audio</li>
					</ul>

		<section id="localization">
			<h2>Localization</h2>
			<p>In these guidelines, we have used simple language to communicate the meaning of the metadata values.
				Many people have contributed to the development of the words and phrases we have selected. We intend to
				provide a mechanism for the publishing community to provide translations that localizes the strings
				for equally effective communication in many languages. We understand that simply translating the
				strings is not enough; the subtle meaning of the words and phrases of accessibility concepts must be
				localized for maximum understanding. </p>
			<p>For users seeking books, a seamless user experience is essential to avoid adding cognitive load to
				the already complex task of understanding the included features and accessing the book.</p>
			<p>The wording is part of the UX and similarities of wordings in language areas are as crucial as the
				organization and categorization of the information.</p>
			<p>The wording proposed in this guide has been widely discussed by a large group representing different
				actors of the English-speaking geographies. It has been improved after proof-of-concept
				implementations and reviewed by panels  of testers.</p>
			<p>To agree on linguistic areas wordings the actors should follow a localization framework. The UX guide
				translation webpage will propose such framework and list translations with contextualization of the
				localization process.</p>

<p>These guidelines provide a general framework and make suggestions on the display of accessibility
				metadata. It is not a normative description of what must be done. It is instructive to provide
				examples of implementations from the community. </p>
